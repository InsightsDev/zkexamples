*Author: "Patrick Hunt":http://people.apache.org/~phunt/* (follow me on "twitter":http://twitter.com/phunt)

h2. Summary

"This project":http://github.com/phunt/zkexamples provides random examples of useful bits of ZooKeeper ephemera that I haven't had a chance to submit back to the ASF ZooKeeper project yet.

h3. What's Apache ZooKeeper?

From the "official site":http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/: "ZooKeeper is a high-performance coordination service for distributed applications."

It exposes common services - such as naming, configuration management, synchronization, and group services - in a simple interface so you don't have to write them from scratch. You can use it off-the-shelf to implement consensus, group management, leader election, and presence protocols.

h2. Usage

Currently just load this as a new project in Eclipse. You will need to download "ZooKeeper":http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/releases.html#Download and add the zookeeper and log4j jars into the Eclipse project. I'm currently building against the 3.2.x release of ZooKeeper.
